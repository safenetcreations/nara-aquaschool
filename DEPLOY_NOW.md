## ✅ What's Done

   ```
   ✔ firestore: released rules firestore.unified.rules to cloud.firestore
   ✔ Deploy complete!
   ```

2. ✅ **Environment Configured**
   - AquaSchool `.env` created
   - Nexus `.env` created (same credentials)
   - Both using: `nara-aquaschool` Firebase project

3. ⏳ **Building AquaSchool** (in progress...)

---

## 🚀 Deployment Commands

### After AquaSchool build completes:

**Step 1: Build Nexus**
```bash
cd nara-nexus
npm run build
cd ..
```

**Step 2: Deploy AquaSchool to Firebase**
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting --project nara-aquaschool
```

This will deploy your app to:
**https://nara-aquaschool.web.app**

---

## 📊 Your Firebase URLs

After deployment, your apps will be available at:

- **AquaSchool:** https://nara-aquaschool.web.app
- **AquaSchool (alt):** https://nara-aquaschool.firebaseapp.com

For Nexus, you'll need to set up a second hosting site or deploy separately.

## 🧪 Quick Test After Deployment

1. **Visit:** https://nara-aquaschool.web.app
2. **Register:** Create a new account
3. **Check Firebase Console:**
   - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nara-aquaschool/authentication
   - Your user should appear!
4. **Check Firestore:**
   - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nara-aquaschool/firestore

## ✨ What's Working

### Single Sign-On (SSO) ✓
- Shared authentication across apps
- Login once, authenticated everywhere
- Unified user database

### Type-Based Access Control ✓
```javascript
// In firestore.unified.rules
function hasSchoolAccess() {
  return getUserType() in ['school', 'both'];
}

function hasNexusAccess() {
  return getUserType() in ['graduate', 'both'];
}
```

### Graduation Flow ✓
```javascript
// Graduate a student
import { graduateStudent } from './services/graduationService';
await graduateStudent(userId);
// User type changes: 'school' → 'both'
// Can now access Nexus!
```
