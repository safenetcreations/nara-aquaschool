```

### User Flow
```
1. Student registers in AquaSchool
   → type: "school"
   → schoolProfile created

2. Student completes Grade 12
   → graduateStudent() called
   → type: "school" → "both"
   → nexusProfile created

3. Student can now access:
   ✓ AquaSchool (all data retained)
   ✓ Nexus (career features unlocked)
```

### Collections Structure
```

## 🚀 Next Steps - What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Create Firebase Project (10 minutes)

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Click "Add project"
3. Name: `NARA Platform`
4. ID: `nara-platform`
5. Enable these services:
   - ✓ Authentication (Email/Password + Google)
   - ✓ Firestore Database (production mode, asia-south1)
   - ✓ Cloud Storage (asia-south1)
   - ✓ Hosting

### Step 2: Configure Environment (5 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/nanthan/Desktop/nara-aquaschool-main

# Create .env files
cp .env.example .env
cp nara-nexus/.env.example nara-nexus/.env

# Edit with your Firebase credentials
nano .env
nano nara-nexus/.env
```

**Get credentials from:**
- Firebase Console → Project Settings → Your Apps → Web App Config

**CRITICAL:** Both `.env` files MUST have IDENTICAL Firebase credentials!

### Step 3: Deploy Security Rules (2 minutes)

```bash
firebase login
firebase use nara-platform
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Step 4: Test Locally (15 minutes)

**Terminal 1 - AquaSchool:**
```bash
npm install
npm start
# Runs at http://localhost:3000
```

**Terminal 2 - Nexus:**
```bash
cd nara-nexus
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
PORT=3001 npm start
# Runs at http://localhost:3001
```

**Test SSO:**
1. Register in AquaSchool
2. Login to Nexus with same email
3. ✨ Automatically authenticated!

### Step 5: Deploy to Production (10 minutes)

```bash
# Build both apps
npm run build
cd nara-nexus && npm run build && cd ..

# Deploy everything
firebase deploy --project nara-platform
```

**Your URLs:**
- AquaSchool: https://aquaschool-{project-id}.web.app
- Nexus: https://nexus-{project-id}.web.app

import { graduateStudent } from './services/graduationService';
import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';

const auth = getAuth();
const userId = auth.currentUser.uid;

// Graduate the current user
const result = await graduateStudent(userId);
console.log(result);

// Expected output:
{
  success: true,
  userType: "both",
  nexusProfileCreated: true,
  message: "Student graduated successfully!"
}
