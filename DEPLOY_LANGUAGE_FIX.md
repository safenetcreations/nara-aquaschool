## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Firebase Hosting (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Build the production version
npm run build

# 2. Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy --only hosting

# 3. Visit your site
# https://nara-aquaschool.web.app/
```

### Option 2: Manual Build

```bash
# Build production files
npm run build

# The build folder will contain all files
# Upload the contents of /build to your hosting provider
```

## 📋 Post-Deployment Checklist

After deploying, verify:

- [ ] Site loads in **English by default**
- [ ] Language selector is **visible in top navbar**
- [ ] Clicking **EN** keeps English
- [ ] Clicking **සිං** switches to Sinhala
- [ ] Clicking **த** switches to Tamil
- [ ] Language choice is **saved** when refreshing
- [ ] No console errors

## 🔧 For Existing Users with Cached Tamil

Existing users who have Tamil cached can:
1. Click the **EN** button in the top navbar
2. Or clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete / Cmd+Shift+Delete)

The site will remember their new language choice.

## 📱 Testing on Different Devices

Test on:
- Desktop browser
- Mobile browser
- Tablet
- Different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

1. **First-time visitors**: See English by default
2. **Returning visitors**: See their last selected language
3. **Language selector**: Always visible in navbar (top right)
4. **Hero section**: Also has larger language chips

## 💡 Additional Notes

- Language preference is stored in browser's localStorage
- No backend/database changes needed
- Works offline after first load
- 21st.dev Toolbar also integrated (dev mode only)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Q: Site still shows Tamil?**
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Or click the EN button in the navbar

**Q: Language buttons not visible?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify build completed successfully
- Clear browser cache

**Q: Language doesn't persist?**
- Check if localStorage is enabled in browser
- Try incognito/private mode to test
