  grade910: "Balaenoptera musculus - largest mammal"
};

const text = getGradeAppropriateText(description, userGrade);
```

#### **3. Generate Grade-Specific Quiz**:
```javascript
import { generateQuiz } from '../data/gradeSpecificQuizzes';

const quiz = generateQuiz('blueWhale', userGrade, 5);
// Returns: { difficulty: 'intermediate', questions: [...], config: {...} }
```

#### **4. Get Dashboard Config**:
```javascript
