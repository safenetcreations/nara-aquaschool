# 🚀 NARA Platform - Live Deployment Status

**Project:** nara-aquaschool (existing Firebase project)
**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Status:** 🟢 DEPLOYING

---

## ✅ Completed Steps

### 1. Environment Configuration ✓
- [x] AquaSchool `.env` created with Firebase credentials
- [x] Nexus `.env` created with SAME Firebase credentials
- [x] Both apps using project: `nara-aquaschool`
- [x] Configuration validated

**Firebase Config:**
```
Project ID: nara-aquaschool
Auth Domain: nara-aquaschool.firebaseapp.com
API Key: AIzaSyBs98CV0NboouXg4E_OOVvIzsi9BTAVFZU
```

### 2. Firebase Project Setup ✓
- [x] Using existing Firebase project
- [x] `.firebaserc` configured with hosting targets
- [x] Multi-site hosting ready

### 3. Security Rules Deployment ⏳
- [ ] Deploying unified security rules to `nara-aquaschool`
- [ ] Rules file: `firestore.unified.rules`
- [ ] Status: In progress...

---

## 🔄 Current Action

**Deploying Security Rules:**
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project nara-aquaschool
```

This will:
1. Compile `firestore.unified.rules`
2. Upload to Firebase
3. Enable SSO access control
4. Protect both AquaSchool and Nexus data

---

## 📋 Next Steps

### After Security Rules Deploy:

**Step 1: Test Locally** (15-20 minutes)
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start AquaSchool
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Start Nexus
cd nara-nexus
PORT=3001 npm start
```

**Test Checklist:**
- [ ] AquaSchool loads at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Nexus loads at http://localhost:3001
- [ ] Register new user in AquaSchool
- [ ] Login to Nexus with same credentials (SSO test)
- [ ] Verify user appears in Firebase Console

---

**Step 2: Build for Production** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Build AquaSchool
npm run build

# Build Nexus
cd nara-nexus
npm run build
cd ..
```

---

**Step 3: Deploy to Firebase Hosting** (5-10 minutes)
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting --project nara-aquaschool
```

This will deploy:
- AquaSchool → https://nara-aquaschool.web.app
- Nexus → https://nexus-nara.web.app (or similar)

---

**Step 4: Production Testing** (15-20 minutes)
- [ ] Test SSO in production
- [ ] Register test users
- [ ] Verify graduation flow
- [ ] Check security rules enforcement

---

## 🎯 Integration Features Ready

### Single Sign-On (SSO) ✓
```
User logs in at AquaSchool
    ↓
Opens Nexus
    ↓
Automatically authenticated! ✨
```

### Type-Based Access Control ✓
- `type: "school"` → AquaSchool only
- `type: "graduate"` → Nexus only
- `type: "both"` → Both platforms (graduated students)

### Graduation Flow ✓
```javascript
import { graduateStudent } from './services/graduationService';
await graduateStudent(userId);
// User can now access both platforms!
```

### Collections Structure ✓
```
nara-aquaschool (Firebase project)
├── users/              (Shared - SSO)
├── schoolProfiles/     (AquaSchool)
├── nexusProfiles/      (Nexus)
├── quizzes/           (AquaSchool only)
├── courses/           (Nexus only)
└── internships/       (Nexus only)
```

## 🔍 How to Verify Deployment

### Check Firebase Console:
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nara-aquaschool
2. **Firestore Database** → Rules tab
   - Should see unified rules with `hasSchoolAccess()` and `hasNexusAccess()`
3. **Authentication** → Settings
   - Ensure Email/Password is enabled
   - Ensure Google sign-in is enabled
4. **Hosting** → Dashboard
   - Will show deployment status after hosting deploy

### Check Local Apps:
```bash
# Verify .env files
cat .env | grep PROJECT_ID
cat nara-nexus/.env | grep PROJECT_ID
# Both should show: nara-aquaschool

# Check dependencies
ls node_modules/firebase
ls nara-nexus/node_modules/firebase
```

---

## 🚨 Quick Troubleshooting

### If security rules fail to deploy:
```bash
# Check rules syntax
cat firestore.unified.rules | head -20

# Try redeploying
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project nara-aquaschool --force
```

### If apps don't start:
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules
npm install

cd nara-nexus
rm -rf node_modules
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### If SSO doesn't work:
```bash
# Verify both .env files match
diff <(grep FIREBASE .env | sort) <(grep FIREBASE nara-nexus/.env | sort)
# Should show no differences in Firebase variables
```
