## 🔧 PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS

### **1. GRADE FILTERING SYSTEM** 🔴 Critical

Create `/src/utils/gradeFilter.js`:
```javascript
export const GRADE_LEVELS = {
  BEGINNER: { grades: [5,6], difficulty: 'easy' },
  INTERMEDIATE: { grades: [7,8], difficulty: 'medium' },
  ADVANCED: { grades: [9,10], difficulty: 'hard', olPrep: true }
};

export const filterByGrade = (content, userGrade) => {
  return content.filter(item => 
    userGrade >= item.gradeMin && userGrade <= item.gradeMax
  );
};
```

### **2. AGE-APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE** 🔴 Critical

Update species descriptions:
```javascript
blueWhale: {
  grade56: "Biggest animal ever! Longer than 3 buses! 🐋",
  grade78: "Largest animal, up to 30m long, weighs 200 tons",
  grade910: "Balaenoptera musculus - largest mammal, reaching 30m"
}
```

### **3. MULTI-LEVEL QUIZZES** 🔴 Critical

```javascript
QUIZ_DIFFICULTY = {
  easy: {  // Grades 5-6
    types: ['multiple-choice', 'true-false'],
    time: 60,
    hints: 3
  },
  medium: {  // Grades 7-8
    types: ['multiple-choice', 'fill-blank'],
    time: 90,
    hints: 2
  },
  hard: {  // Grades 9-10
    types: ['short-answer', 'essay'],
    time: 120,
    hints: 1,
    olAligned: true
  }
};
```

### **4. GRADE-SPECIFIC GAMES** 🟡 Important

**Grade 5-6**: Coloring, Memory Match, Sound Matching  
**Grade 7-8**: Food Chain Builder, Ecosystem Simulator  
**Grade 9-10**: Data Analysis, Research Projects  

### **5. O/L SYLLABUS MAPPING** 🟡 Important

```javascript
OL_SYLLABUS = {
  unit14_biodiversity: {
    content: ['marine-species', 'conservation', 'endemic-species'],
    grade: [9,10]
  },
  unit15_environment: {
    content: ['ecosystems', 'pollution', 'sustainability'],
    grade: [9,10]
  }
};
```
