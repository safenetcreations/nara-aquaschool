        },
        modelAnswer: 'The baleen feeding mechanism represents a specialized adaptation allowing blue whales to efficiently harvest small prey. Baleen plates are keratinous structures that act as a filtration system. When feeding, whales engulf large volumes of water containing krill, then use their tongue to push water out through baleen plates which trap the krill. This adaptation is highly efficient for consuming the massive quantities of small prey needed to sustain their enormous body size, demonstrating evolutionary specialization to their ecological niche.'
