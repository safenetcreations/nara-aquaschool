## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Firebase Project: nara-platform    │
│   • Authentication (SSO)             │
│   • Firestore Database (Shared)     │
│   • Cloud Storage (Shared)           │
│   • Hosting (2 sites)                │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓                    ↓

🏫 AquaSchool           🎓 Nexus
aquaschool.nara.ac.lk  nexus.nara.ac.lk
```

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Types

```typescript
// users collection structure
{
  uid: "abc123",
  email: "student@email.com",
  type: "school" | "graduate" | "both",
  schoolProfile?: ref(schoolProfiles/abc123),
  nexusProfile?: ref(nexusProfiles/abc123)
}
```

**Access Control:**
- `type: "school"` → Can access AquaSchool only
- `type: "graduate"` → Can access Nexus only
- `type: "both"` → Can access BOTH apps (graduated students!)

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

```
1. User logs in at aquaschool.nara.ac.lk
   → Firebase creates auth token

2. User clicks "Explore Nexus" link
   → Opens nexus.nara.ac.lk
   → Same Firebase auth token works!
   → Automatically logged in

3. Check user.type to determine access
   → If type="school" → Redirect back
   → If type="both" → Welcome!
```

### Graduation Flow

```
Grade 12 Student completes school:
1. Update user.type from "school" → "both"
2. Create nexusProfile document
3. Show congratulations banner
4. Link to Nexus onboarding

Student can now access:
✓ AquaSchool (all previous data retained)
✓ Nexus (new career features unlocked)
```

---

## 📦 What's Shared

### Same Firebase Project
✓ Authentication - One login for both apps
✓ User database - Shared users collection
✓ Security rules - One ruleset
✓ Storage - Shared file storage
✓ Analytics - Unified tracking

### Separate
✗ Code - Independent codebases
✗ UI - Different design systems
✗ Tech stack - React 18 vs React 19
✗ Deployments - Independent
✗ Collections - Scoped by feature

---

## 🚀 Next Steps - Implementation

### Phase 1: Firebase Setup (30 min)

```bash
# 1. Create Firebase project
firebase login
firebase projects:create nara-platform

# 2. Enable services (in Firebase Console)
- Authentication (Email + Google)
- Firestore Database
- Cloud Storage
- Firebase Hosting

# 3. Deploy security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Phase 2: Update AquaSchool (1-2 hours)

**Files to Modify:**

1. **Create `.env` file**
   ```bash
   # Add Firebase credentials for nara-platform
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=nara-platform
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
   # etc.
   ```

2. **Update `src/config/firebase.js`**
   - Use environment variables
   - Connect to nara-platform

3. **Update `src/services/authService.js`**
   - Modify user creation to use new schema
   - Set user.type = 'school'
   - Create schoolProfile document

4. **Add Graduation Banner** (optional now)
   ```jsx
   // src/components/GraduationBanner.jsx
   // Show to Grade 12 students
   // Link to Nexus platform
   ```

5. **Test locally**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   # Register new user
   # Check Firestore for correct schema
   ```

### Phase 3: Update Nexus (1-2 hours)

**Files to Modify:**

1. **Create `.env` file**
   ```bash
   # Use SAME credentials as AquaSchool!
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=nara-platform
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
   ```

2. **Update `src/config/firebase.ts`**
   - Use environment variables
   - Connect to nara-platform

3. **Update AuthContext**
   - Modify user creation to use new schema
   - Set user.type = 'graduate'
   - Create nexusProfile document

4. **Add Onboarding Flow**
   ```tsx
   // src/pages/Onboarding.tsx
   // Guide new graduates through setup
   ```

5. **Test locally**
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   npm start
   # Register new user
   # Login with AquaSchool user (SSO!)
   ```

### Phase 4: Deploy (30 min)

```bash
# Build both apps
cd nara-aquaschool-main
npm run build

cd nara-nexus
npm run build

# Deploy to Firebase Hosting
cd ..
firebase deploy
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Authentication Tests
- [ ] Register new student in AquaSchool
- [ ] Register new graduate in Nexus
- [ ] Login to AquaSchool, then open Nexus (SSO)
- [ ] Login to Nexus, then open AquaSchool (SSO)
- [ ] Logout from one app, verify logged out of both

### Data Access Tests
- [ ] Student can see quizzes (AquaSchool only)
- [ ] Graduate cannot see quizzes (blocked by rules)
- [ ] Graduate can see internships (Nexus only)
- [ ] Student cannot see internships (blocked by rules)
- [ ] User with type="both" can see everything

### Graduation Flow Tests
- [ ] Manually update student user.type to "both"
- [ ] Verify student can now access Nexus
- [ ] Verify school data is retained
- [ ] Verify Nexus onboarding shows

### Cross-App Tests
- [ ] Link from AquaSchool to Nexus works

## 💰 Cost Estimate

### Firebase (Blaze Plan - Pay as you go)

**Free Tier (Monthly):**
- Authentication: 10k verifications
- Firestore: 50k reads, 20k writes, 20k deletes
- Storage: 5 GB, 1 GB egress
- Hosting: 10 GB, 360 MB/day

**Estimated Monthly Cost:**
- 100 students + 20 graduates = **FREE** (within limits)
- 1000 students + 200 graduates = **$5-10/month**
- 10,000 students + 2000 graduates = **$50-100/month**

**Scaling:**
- Firestore: $0.06 per 100k reads
- Storage: $0.026/GB
- Hosting: $0.15/GB

**Recommendation:** Start with Blaze plan, set budget alert at $10/month

## 🎓 Graduation Flow Implementation (Detailed)

### Option 1: Manual (Admin Portal)
```typescript
// Admin dashboard function
async function graduateStudent(studentId: string) {
  const userRef = doc(db, 'users', studentId);

  await updateDoc(userRef, {
    type: 'both',
    isGraduated: true,
    graduationDate: serverTimestamp()
  });

  // Create Nexus profile
  await setDoc(doc(db, 'nexusProfiles', studentId), {
    uid: studentId,
    onboardingComplete: false,
    createdAt: serverTimestamp()
  });
}
```

### Option 2: Automatic (Firebase Function)
```typescript
// Firebase Cloud Function
exports.autoGraduateStudents = functions.pubsub
  .schedule('every day 00:00')
  .onRun(async () => {
    // Query students in Grade 12 who completed
    const students = await db.collection('schoolProfiles')
      .where('grade', '==', 12)
      .where('completionStatus', '==', 'completed')
      .get();

    // Graduate each student
    for (const student of students.docs) {
      await graduateStudent(student.id);
    }
  });
```

### Option 3: Self-Service (Student Request)
```jsx
// In AquaSchool dashboard for Grade 12
<Card>
  <h3>Ready to Graduate?</h3>
  <p>Unlock NARA Nexus - Career & Research Platform</p>
  <Button onClick={handleGraduationRequest}>
    Request Graduation Access
  </Button>
</Card>
```
